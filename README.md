# Montgomery County Car Crash Analysis (Tableau Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes vehicle collision data from **Montgomery County, Maryland** using **Tableau** to uncover insights about road conditions, driver behavior, and vehicle attributes that contribute to crashes.  

The goal was to turn raw vehicle crash data into **actionable business insights** that can inform public safety initiatives, insurance modeling, and urban planning.

## Data Source
- **Dataset Created:** November 10, 2020  
- **Observation Period:** January 1, 2015 – February 9, 2024  
- **Source:** Automated Crash Reporting System, Maryland State Police  
- **Notes:** Data is preliminary and does not represent the full population of crashes.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed 20,000+ irrelevant vehicle types (tractors, autocycles, buses, motorcycles, etc.) before visualization.

## Variables Analyzed
**Road Conditions**
- Time & location of accident  
- Weather conditions  
- Speed limit & surface conditions  

**Driver Conditions**
- Substance use  
- Fault attribution  
- Distracted driving  

**Vehicle Conditions**
- Make & model  
- Body type  
- Year of manufacture  
- Movement at time of crash  

**Response Variables**
- Injury severity  
- Collision type  
- Extent of vehicle damage

## Key Insights (from Tableau Dashboards)

### Road Conditions
- Crashes peak during **weekday rush hours** and in **high-traffic areas** (shopping centers, schools, churches).  
- Most accidents occurred under **ideal weather conditions**, highlighting that traffic density > weather in predicting accidents.

### Vehicle Conditions
- Accidents peaked in cars manufactured in **2007** and **2015**.  
- Passenger cars from **Toyota, Honda, and Nissan** (Camry, Corolla, Civic, Accord, Altima) accounted for the majority of crashes.  
- Across body types, accidents were most often caused by vehicles moving at a **constant speed**.

### Driver Conditions
- **Substance abuse** strongly correlated with fault attribution.  
- **Non-distracted drivers** were still often found at fault when no traffic controls or only traffic signals were present.  
- **Traffic infrastructure** plays a key role in reducing driver error and confusion.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Tableau**: Data visualization, dashboard design, storytelling with data  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removing irrelevant categories, preparing data for visualization  
- **Business Analysis**: Translating findings into real-world recommendations  
- **Communication Skills**: Turning raw datasets into clear visual narratives  

---

## Potential Applications
- **Insurance Companies** → Adjust risk models for specific car makes/years most associated with crashes.  
- **Urban Planners** → Improve traffic signal placement and road design.  
- **Public Safety Campaigns** → Target campaigns around distracted and impaired driving.

## Conclusion
This Tableau project demonstrates how raw crash data can be transformed into clear insights that influence **business decisions, policy, and safety measures**.  

It highlights my ability to use **Tableau for data storytelling** and to bridge the gap between **data analysis and actionable recommendations**.
